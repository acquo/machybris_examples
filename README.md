# machybris_samples
samples of how to use machybris in your code - for sharing and study purposes:

- test_vpu: simple encoder / decoder example for raw video bitstreams (eg h264, ...) to/from vpu frames (nv21) using vpu; with decode every x-th nv21 frame is converted to tga image file that you can display with eog; use gstreamer, ffmpeg or avconv to decode/ encode raw streams (eg .mov or h264 movie file to h264 video bit stream)
